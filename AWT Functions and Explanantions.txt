DOS(Disk Operating System)  - Character use Interface (CUI)
Windows Operating System and MAC - Graphical User Interface (GUI)

-> Why we need GUI ?
Just to have a better look and feel of Window Operating System or any Operating that we use. Each Operating System has its own Unique GUI. 


All the Programs that we practised till now and we executed the Output in the CMD is considered as CUI - Characted Based Interface. 

-> Different FrameWorks for Developing GUI :
AWT - Abstract Window Interface (Outdated GUI)
Swings - (Outdated GUI)
JavaFX - Currently used GUI in Java
